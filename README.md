# Project 1: Walmart Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Walmart to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The primary goal was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales performance across different stores and departments, considering factors like holidays and store size.

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods.
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, identifying outliers, and preparing the data for analysis.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating visual representations of data findings (within the notebook).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applying basic statistical methods to identify trends and correlations.

## Tools Used

* **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
    * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Google Colab:** As the development environment for the Python notebook.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint:** For summarizing findings and presenting key insights.
